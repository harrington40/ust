Overview
This project adopts a straightforward approach to managing multiple Python files, each containing separate implementations, along with a dedicated unit test module. This structure is particularly well-suited for smaller projects or when simplicity is key during development and testing phases.

Project Structure
Implementation Files: The project includes five Python files, each with a distinct implementation. These files are designed to handle various aspects of the project's functionality.
Main Runner (main_runner.py): This is the entry point of the application. It calls and integrates the implementations from the individual Python files.
Unit Test Module (unit_test.py): Contains all unit tests for the project. It is structured to thoroughly test the functionality of the implementations in the other Python files.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these simple steps:

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Installation
Clone the repository or download the source code.
Navigate to the project directory.
Running the Application
Execute the following command in the terminal:


python main_runner.py
This will run the main application, utilizing the separate implementations from the Python files.

Running Unit Tests
To run the unit tests, execute:


python unit_test.py
This will run all the tests defined in the unit_test.py file, ensuring that the implementations function as expected.
